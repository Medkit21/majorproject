# Major Project Proposal

## Description
My major project is going to be a clone or copy of the Hearts of Iron 4 mod Kaiserreich, which is a strategy game with an alternate
history scenario depiciting what would happen if the German Empire won the first World War.

## Need To Have List
- An alternate map of the world depicting the borders between nations in Kaiserreich.
- A generic national focus tree for each nation.
- A tab dedicated to modifying a country's policies (policies such as conscription, economy laws and mobilisiation). A tab for decisions
for your country. A tab for diplomacy. A tab for trading resources. A tab for researching a variety of different things. A tab for
construction. A tab for managing military factories for producing different type of equipment. A tab for training and deploying units.
- Nations with different ideologies(monarchism, syndicalism, democracy, populism etc.)
