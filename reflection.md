# My Reflection

## Hardest
The Hardest would have to be the Units themselves and setting it up so that they can build stuff and move around without teleporting to the selected area

## If I were to do it again?
I would probably would've actually commit more time to it instead of wasting my time doing other things.

## What I was able to finish from my proposal
I was able to finish all but the regions, the battle mechanic, obstacle faction and the drawable supply lines
